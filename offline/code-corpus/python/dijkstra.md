```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]
    while pq:
        dist, node = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if dist > distances[node]:
            continue
        for neighbor, weight in graph[node].items():
            new_dist = dist + weight
            if new_dist < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = new_dist
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dist, neighbor))
    return distances
```
