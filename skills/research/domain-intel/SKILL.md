# Domain Intelligence — Passive OSINT

Passive domain reconnaissance using only Python stdlib.
**Zero dependencies. Zero API keys. Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.**

## Helper script

This skill includes `scripts/domain_intel.py` — a complete CLI tool for all domain intelligence operations.

```bash
# Subdomain discovery via Certificate Transparency logs
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/domain_intel.py subdomains example.com

# SSL certificate inspection (expiry, cipher, SANs, issuer)
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/domain_intel.py ssl example.com

# WHOIS lookup (registrar, dates, name servers — 100+ TLDs)
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/domain_intel.py whois example.com

# DNS records (A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, CNAME)
